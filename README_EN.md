# Reall3dViewer

`Reall3dViewer` is a 3D Gaussian Splatting viewer built on Three.js. Crafting an exceptional 3DGS viewer is no small feat, which is why we've chosen to open-source our project. We hope to harness the collective wisdom and efforts of the community to drive the advancement of 3DGS applications together!

## Key Configuration Parameters

| Name                         | Note                               |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `maxRenderCountOfMobile`     | Low-end devices have rendering limits. Adjust from default if needed. Recommended.    |
| `maxRenderCountOfPc`         | High-end devices also have rendering limits. Adjust from default if needed. Recommended.   |
| `qualityLevel`               | Choose based on target device and model for optimal performance/quality. Adaptive adjustment supported. Recommended.    |
| `sortType`                   | No single algorithm is optimal for all scenarios. Choose the most suitable one from built-in types for your case. Recommended.  |


## `.spx`

- Format Specification: https://github.com/reall3d-com/Reall3dViewer/blob/main/SPX_EN.md
- Conversion Tool: https://github.com/gotoeasy/gsbox

## Basic Usage

use source code
```shell
# develop
npm run dev

# build
npm run build

# open a web browser to render your 3dgs model
# http://hostname:port/index.html?url=your-model-link-address

# .spx file can be obtained through conversion using the gsbox
gsbox p2x -i /path/to/input.ply -o /path/to/output.spx -sh 0
```

use npm package [sample project here](https://github.com/reall3d-com/reall3dviewer-samples-use-npm-package)
```shell
# install
npm install @reall3d/reall3dviewer

# use built-in viewer
const viewer = new Reall3dViewer({ root: '#gsviewer' });
viewer.addModel(`https://reall3d.com/demo-models/yz.spx`);

# use splat mesh
const splatMesh = new SplatMesh({ renderer, scene, controls});
splatMesh.addModel({ url: 'https://reall3d.com/demo-models/yz.spx' });
scene.add(splatMesh);
```
